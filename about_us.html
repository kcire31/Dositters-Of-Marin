                <div class="img-aboutme">
                    <p><b>Brenda</b> was raised in <b>Marin County</b> and did her K-12th grade schooling locally. She adopted her childhood dog, <b>Canela</b>, in kindergarden, whom she walked daily around the <b>Marin County Parks</b> until moving away for university. She currently has a rescue dog at home named <b>Chico</b> whom she has personally trained to be in public settings as well as to do <b>tricks</b> such as to <b>sit</b>, <b>stay</b>, <b>lay down</b>, <b>spin</b>, and <b>high-five</b>. When she was working at a <b>dog shelter</b> in <b>Guatemala</b> she trained a lot of puppies who hadn't had much socialization to walk in public areas, not bark, and to be by her side on the walks. She does a great job building rapport with <b>new dogs</b> and is a great <b>multi-tasker</b>. Apart from having <b>20+ years</b> of being dog owner, she is a <b>doctoral student</b> and black belt in karate and kickboxing.</p>

                    <p><b>Erick</b> had his first childhood dog, <b>Sassy</b>, when he was in elementary school. He was responsible for taking care of her and feeding her since he was little. Erick recently moved to <b>Marin County</b> and is originally from South America. Before moving here, he had another family dog named <b>Toby</b>, as well as two cats named <b>Cata</b> and <b>Pelusa</b>. When Erick worked at a <b>dog shelter</b> in <b>Guatemala</b>, he was primarily responsible for <b>giving medications</b> to multiple dogs various times a day when the owners were away. He is incredibly <b>responsible</b> and <b>organized</b>. He is also exceptionally great at his ability to manage various dogs at a time during a walk. Apart from <b>15+ years</b> of being a pet owner, Erick is also an engineer, trilingual in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, and has professional experience in various job fields in Peru, Mexico, and Guatemala.</p>
